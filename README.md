<strong>Time MCP Server</strong>

*A Model Context Protocol server that enables AI assistants to interact with time*

</div>

## Overview

The Time MCP Server is a [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol) server that provides AI assistants and other MCP clients with standardized tools to perform time and date-related operations. This server acts as a bridge between AI tools and a robust time-handling backend, allowing for complex time manipulations through natural language interactions.

## Features

- **‚è∞ Time Manipulation** - Get current time, convert between timezones, and add or subtract durations
- **üó£Ô∏è Natural Language Parsing** - Understands relative time expressions like "yesterday" or "next month"
- **‚öñÔ∏è Time Comparison** - Compare two different times with ease
- **üé® Flexible Formatting** - Supports a wide variety of predefined and custom time formats
- **‚úÖ MCP Compliance** - Fully compatible with the Model Context Protocol standard
- **üîÑ Multiple Transports** - Supports `stdio` for local integrations and `HTTP stream` for network access

## Installation

This MCP server can be integrated with various AI assistant clients that support the Model Context Protocol, including [Cursor](https://cursor.com/), [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download), [Claude Code](https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code), and [many more](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients).

### üöÄ One-Click Install (Cursor)

Click the button below to automatically configure the MCP server using Docker in your [Cursor](https://cursor.com) environment:

</a>

### Using npx (JavaScript/Node.js)

This method runs the MCP server using [`npx`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npx), which requires Node.js to be installed. Copy the following JSON configuration into your MCP client settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-time": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@theo.foobar/mcp-time"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Using Docker

Run the MCP server in an isolated container. Requires [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) to be installed. Copy this JSON configuration into your MCP client settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-time": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "theo01/mcp-time:latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Using binary

Install the `mcp-time` binary directly on your system. Choose one of the installation methods below, ensuring the binary is placed in a directory that's in your `PATH`. Then add this JSON configuration to your MCP client settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-time": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "mcp-time"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Option 1: Download from Releases

Download the latest pre-built binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/TheoBrigitte/mcp-time/releases):

```bash
# Replace OS-ARCH with your platform (e.g., linux-amd64, darwin-arm64, windows-amd64)
curl -Lo mcp-time https://github.com/TheoBrigitte/mcp-time/releases/latest/download/mcp-time.OS-ARCH
install -D -m 755 ./mcp-time ~/.local/bin/mcp-time
```

#### Option 2: Install with Go

For Go developers, install directly using `go install`:

```bash
go install github.com/TheoBrigitte/mcp-time/cmd/mcp-time@latest
```

The binary will be installed in your `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

#### Option 3: Build from Source

Clone and build the project using `make`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheoBrigitte/mcp-time.git
cd mcp-time
make install
```

The binary will be installed in `~/.local/bin/mcp-time`.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

**Start with stdio transport** (default, for MCP clients):
```bash
mcp-time
```

**Start with HTTP stream transport** (for network access):
```bash
mcp-time --transport stream --address "http://localhost:8080/mcp"
```

### Command-Line Options

The server supports the following flags for advanced configurations:

```
$ mcp-time --help
An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server which provides utilities to work with time and dates.

Usage:
  mcp-time [flags]

Flags:
      --address string     Listen address for Stream HTTP Server (only for --transport stream) (default "http://localhost:8080/mcp")
  -h, --help               help for mcp-time
      --log-file string    Path to log file (logs is disabled if not specified)
  -t, --transport string   Transport layer: stdio, stream. (default "stdio")
      --version            Print version information and exit
```

### `add_time`

Add or subtract a duration from a given time.

**Parameters:**
- `time` (required) - Input time string
- `duration` (required) - Duration to add/subtract (e.g., `2h30m`, `-1h`, `24h`)
- `timezone` (optional) - Target timezone for the output
- `format` (optional) - Output format for the time

**Example:** "What time will it be in 45 minutes?"

### `compare_time`

Compare two times and determine their relationship. Supports timezone-aware comparisons.

**Parameters:**
